  Our project, Got, is a version control system, similar to Git. It implements 
  commands standard to Git such as init, add, status, log, and diff. 

  The main functionality that Got will support is 
  (1) Saving directories or files
  (2) Restore past versions of files 
  (3) Viewing past backups 
  
  Users can interact with Got via the command line.
