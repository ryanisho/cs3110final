  Our project, Got, is a version control system, similar to Git. It implements 
  commands standard to Git such as init, add, commit, status, log, reset, branch, checkout. 

  The main functionality that Got will support is 
  (1) Saving files and directories
  (2) Restoring past versions of files and directories
  (3) Working across multiple branches
  
  Users can interact with Got via the command line. Run `/.got` to see the list of commands!
